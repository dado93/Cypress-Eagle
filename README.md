# Cypress-Eagle
This repository contains an Eagle library for Cypress devices. 

## CY8CKIT-059
The library provides the footprints to be used with the famous [CY8CKIT-059](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit-onboard-programmer-and) PSoC 5LP kit. You can use the devices present in this library to place your kit on the PCB, using 0.1" female headers (so that you don't have to solder the kit directly to the PCB). 

## PSoC 5LP
This library provides the footprints to be used with [PSoC5LP](https://www.cypress.com/products/32-bit-arm-cortex-m3-psoc-5lp) micro-controllers (no kits). At the moment, the 100 TQFP package is included.

### Library setup
